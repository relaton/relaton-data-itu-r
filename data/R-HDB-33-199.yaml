abstract:
  content: This Handbook provides practical and illustrative guidance (even to radio
    engineers not having been previously exposed to the specific task of HF broadcasting
    service planning). Considerable effort has been made to meet the expectations
    of HF broadcasting engineers from the developing world. This publication includes
    relevant texts from existing ITU-R Recommendations as well as advanced material.
