abstract:
  content: This Handbook should be seen as complementary to Handbooks 'National Spectrum
    Management' (2015) and 'Spectrum Monitoring' (2011). The topic of national spectrum
    management has evolved and become the central hot spot in the activities of all
    telecommunication administrations. This is particularly true for developing countries,
    where the dramatic development of ICT technologies and their wide application
    have led to a heavy increase in related spectrum usage. The user/reader will find
    basic material and numerous models for developing efficient projects that will
    assist in reaching their objective - implementing automated spectrum management
    as soon as possible.
