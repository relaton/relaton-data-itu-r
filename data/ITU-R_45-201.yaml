abstract:
- content: Timely warning of natural and environmental disasters and accurate climate
    prediction, in addition to understanding, conservation and efficient management
    of scarce resources such as biomass, biosphere, mineral resources, water and energy
    are essential requirements for sustainable economic development. Information about
    climate, climate change, weather, cryosphere, precipitation, pollution and disasters
    is a critically important everyday issue for the global community.   Radio systems
    are fundamental to monitoring the climate and to helping countries mitigate and
    adapt to the effects of climate change, and to address its major challenges. This
    Handbook provides an overview of the use of radiocommunication systems to monitor
    the various manifestations of climate change and their impact, as well as the
    application of ICTs and radiocommunication as a means to reduce global energy
    consumption.Please note the availability of the English pdf and English hard-copy
    edition.  Other language editions now available in pdf (free) or hard-copy upon
    request only (paying).  Any pre-order will be charged in full.  Thank you for
    your understanding.
