abstract:
  content: Teletext systems provide the means to supplement an analogue television
    broadcast with digitally coded data signals carried in the vertical interval.
    The data signals can be displayed on the viewers receiver as printed text or diagrams,
    or possibly more elaborate multimedia. This Handbook currently in use worldwide
    as defined in ITU-R Recommendations. They are described in four Sections in a
    similar way, so that readers can understand the differences and similarities.
