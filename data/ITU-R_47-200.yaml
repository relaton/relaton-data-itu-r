abstract:
- content: The purpose of the Land Mobile Handbook is to assist in the decision-making
    process involving planning, engineering and deployment of land mobile systems,
    especially in the developing countries. It should also provide adequate information
    to assist in training engineers and planners in regulating, planning, engineering
    and deployment aspects of these systems. Volume 3 on Dispatch and Advanced Messaging
    Systems provides information on state-of-the-art technology in terrestrial land
    mobile paging and advanced messaging and dispatch as well as descriptions of typical
    systems. The technical content is intended for use by administrations and operators
