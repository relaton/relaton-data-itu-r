abstract:
- content: The Handbook on Radio Astronomy has been developed by experts of Working
    Party 7D of ITU-R Study Group 7 (Science Services) that is responsible for radio
    astronomy. This Handbook is not intended as a source book on radio astronomy,
    but rather deals with such aspects of radio astronomy that are relevant to frequency
    coordination as the management of radio spectrum usage in order to minimize interference
    between radiocommunication services.
