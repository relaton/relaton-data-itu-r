    of radiocommunication services associated with disasters include,\tinter alia,
    disaster prediction, detection, alerting and disaster relief. In certain cases,
    when the 'wired' telecommunication infrastructure is significantly or completely
    destroyed by a disaster, only radiocommunication services can be employed for
    disaster relief operation."
