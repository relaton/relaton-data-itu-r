abstract:
  content: The ITU-R Handbook - Radiowave propagation information for designing terrestrial
    point-to-point links supplies background and supplementary information on radiowave
    propagation effects, and serves as a companion volume and guide to the ITU-R Recommendations
    that have been developed by Radiocommunication Study Group 3 to assist in the
    design of terrestrial communication systems.
