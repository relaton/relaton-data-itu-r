abstract:
- content: The Handbook on ground wave propagation is of special interest for communication,
    particularly broadcasting, at the lower frequencies where the mode has been in
    use for more than 90 years. It deals with fundamentals and theory, wide-scale
    considerations and prediction methods used for compatibility assessments and planning
    procedures. Smaller scale variability, which may be of major importance in assessing
    the quality of services, is also treated. The topics of measurements and phase
    are also covered.
