abstract:
- content: This revised Supplement expands on the first edition of the ITU Handbook
    - Deployment of IMT- 2000 Systems and updates much of the work that has occurred
    since the release of the Handbook. It  addresses the subject of evolution and
    migration from current mobile systems towards IMT-2000. ITU-R has developed this
    work in response to ongoing liaison and interaction with the ITU-D and ITU-T Sectors
    and sees this material as the natural extension of the information presented in
    the Handbook.
